### Objective

Your assignment is to implement a movie streaming dashboard using TypeScript and React.

### Brief

You are the owner of a movie theater in **Thikkiiana City,** on the Wookiee homeworld of Kashyyyk. Your customers are bored with the never changing selection and are asking for something completely different - they want to see what's playing on Earth. Wookies are the main exporter of Computer Technology for the New Republic so naturally you roll up your sleeves and get to work. You quickly scribble down some notes and after a few hours of relentless work you have a design in mind.

### Tasks

-   Implement assignment using:
    -   Language: **TypeScript**
    -   Framework: **React**
-   Build out the project to the designs inside the `/Designs` folder
-   Connect your application to the **CodeSubmit Movie Database** at `https://wookie.codesubmit.io/movies`
-   For authentication pass the `"Authorization: Bearer Wookie2021"` header
-   Parse the API response and display the results as outlined in the design. **Make sure to group movies by categories**.
-   Implement a detail view for the movies in the list
-   Make sure that linking to detail pages as well as bookmarking works as expected
-   Implement search by connecting to `https://wookie.codesubmit.io/movies?q=<search_term>`

### Deliverables

Make sure to include all source code in the repository. 

### Evaluation Criteria

-   [x] **TypeScript** best practices
-   [x] We're looking for you to produce working code, with enough room to demonstrate how to structure components in a small program.
-   [x] Show us your work through your commit history
-   [ ] Completeness: did you complete the features?
-   [ ] Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
-   [ ] Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
-   [ ] Testing: is the system adequately tested?

### Solution
**Screenshots**

### Thoughts

-   Mobile responsiveness wasn't a priority for this project, but it's a good idea to have a responsive design.
-   I would like to see a more detailed view of the movie details. be able to click on the cast and crew members to see their details or see other movies they star in.
-   some challenges that were a bit unexpected, is sorting the movies according genre, I initially thought the movies belonged to a certain genre, but I realized that the genre was a list.


### CodeSubmit

Please organize, design, test and document your code as if it were
going into production - then push your changes to the master branch. After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

All the best and happy coding,
